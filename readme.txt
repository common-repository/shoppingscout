Plugin which puts price comparison ShoppingScout button on your site 

== Description ==
ShoppingScout is a grocery price comparison button that saves you time & money, and helps you shop smarter. We compare prices and deals at local and online stores to maximize your savings. 

The plugin works without the blogger already having a ShoppingScout account; 
blog readers hit the website and the blogger will have entered the apropriate ingredients into the plugin.  
When a blog reader clicks the button, a pop-up window appears asking for a zip code and email address.  
Those two pieces of information along with the ingredients list are then passed to the ShoppingScout pricing database which create an email to the blog reader with pricing and purchase location information.
